• Implemented unsupervised topic modeling on articles from 20+ websites using an approach based on TF-IDF scores from n-gram frequencies, indexing scores, and other relevant metrics for internal linking to increase back-links.
• Utilized sentence-transformer for efficient article clustering based on predefined topics, generating sentence embeddings similar to word2vec.
• Leveraged LLM(large language models) like ChatGPT for accurate topic tagging across diverse articles with appropriate prompts, enhancing content categorization and accessibility and conducting in-depth performance and competitor analysis, translating data into actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
• Designed and implemented multiple NLP-related widget applications, then containerized them using Docker for efficient deployment. These applications were deployed on Nomad servers, serving as API endpoints, which enhanced website functionality and contributed to increased web traffic by 15%.
• Developed data visualizations and dashboards with Matplotlib for conveying insights and actionable recommendations. This approach led to the removal of 25% of low-quality pages, which only contributed 5% to the overall domain revenue
